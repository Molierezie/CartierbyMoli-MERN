# map

## what's the specificity ?

Map is a collection of keyed data items, just like an Object. But the main difference is that Map allows keys of any type.

`If I log what's appears in the console `?

`how I add the value `?

`how I get a value `?

`how I can verify if a value is in the array `?


# set

## what's the specificity ?

- the new meto 'set' only allows a unique key value, this garanted with set the duplicates value was ignored

- 

- The method set have an items inside ?

## practice


`show an example of this specificity`


```js

```

`show for add, delete, see the size and verifiy if there is a value or doesn't in the array`
